# 🌱 The Odin Project – Foundations

Hi! 👋 This is my personal repo for the **Foundations** course from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

I'm using this space to practice the basics of web development, including:

- 🧱 HTML
- 🎨 CSS
- 🧠 JavaScript
- 🧰 Git & GitHub

As I go through the course, I'll be adding my small projects and experiments here. It's all part of my journey to becoming a full stack web developer 👨‍💻


💻 Built with curiosity and caffeine ☕
